# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shai

ðŸŽ“ I'm a final-year Computer Science student at Afeka College of Engineering with a strong background in IT and a passion for software development, DevOps, and game development.

ðŸ’» I have 3+ years of hands-on experience working in IT roles at global companies. I'm skilled in scripting, automation, and systems administration, and now Iâ€™m transitioning into software engineering and development.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently working on **LeagueLink** â€“ a platform for managing amateur and professional sports tournaments. It combines React, Node.js, MongoDB, and custom algorithms to support league creation, match tracking, and chat-based community building.

ðŸ§  I'm always learning â€” from Docker and Python to C++, Unreal Engine, and machine learning. I enjoy solving problems, building projects from scratch, and learning how to scale real-world applications.

ðŸ§© Fun fact: I love building systems that combine text and image analysis â€“ one of my side projects is an AI-based t-shirt design tool from user prompts!
